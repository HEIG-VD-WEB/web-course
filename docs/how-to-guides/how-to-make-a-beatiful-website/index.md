# How to make a beautiful website

Maybe you ask yourself: Why does my website does not look like the others ? Is there a golden rule of beauty ?

I suggest you read up on the 60-30-10 rule, and start with [this article](https://uxplanet.org/the-60-30-10-rule-a-foolproof-way-to-choose-colors-for-your-ui-design-d15625e56d25){:target="_blank"}.

Tired of setting up your own colour palette ? You can use [this tool](https://coolors.co/){:target="_blank"} to generate a colour palette.

Want to play with the colors a little ? Try [this tool](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel){:target="_blank"}.

Tired of creating html structures and css classes? You can use [this tool](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/){:target="_blank"}.

In truth, apart from trial and error and trying out the best colour combinations, I don't think there's any magic formula.
