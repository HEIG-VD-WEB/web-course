## Practice courses

All the practical courses will be available if they exist. If the students are ahead of schedule, they can help other, test new things or help enhance the course.

Some ideas for the assignement:

 - A compute viewer using the design pattern Composite ;
 - The top would be one application for the whole semester and we add features to it ;
 - A chat application to ask question to the teacher without problem of privacy, or the need of prompting hands. The top would be to link it to a slide, so the question has meaning and we can enhance the slide ;
 - Do a simple grades calculator with average and everything.

At the end of the assignement, there is a quiz to know how good it was.
