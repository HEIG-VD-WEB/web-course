## Remarks

- You can use any frontend framework you want, Vue, React, Angular, Svelte, etc.
- You can use any backend framework you want, Express, Fastify, NestJS, etc.
- You can use any package manager you want, npm, yarn, pnpm, etc.
- You can use Swagger/Open API to document your API.
- You can replace Docker with one of its alternatives (Podman, Buildah, etc.)
- You can use anything you want to create your website as long as you specify the source.
- You can use Material UI, Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc. to style your website.
You do not need to deploy your website.

## Submission

The deadline is the 28th of January 2024 at 22h00 (Sunday)

Any commit after the deadline will not be taken into account. Each day of delay will result in a penalty of -1 point on the final grade.

To submit your work, create a new GitHub Discussion at <https://github.com/orgs/HEIG-VD-WEB/discussions> with the following information:

- **Title**: WEB 2023-2024 - Practical work 3 - First names of the students
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: The URL of your repository

If your repository is private, you must add me as collaborator to your repository!

If you don't want your first name to appear on GitHub, you can use your GitHub username instead. Juste email me to let me know.

## Grades and feedback

Grades will be entered into GAPS, followed by an email with the feedback.

The evaluation will use exactly the same grading grid as shown in the course material.

Each criterion will be accompanied by a comment explaining the points obtained, a general comment on your work and the final grade.

If you have any questions about the evaluation, you can contact me!

## Promoting success

I encourage you to use TypeScript.

If you do a video game and want everyone to play it on the last day of the course, I'm in! And I can give you the resources you need to do it (hosting, domain name, etc.)

Here is a tutorial to create an interactive drawing application: <https://docs.beescreens.ch/tutorials/create-an-interactive-drawing-application/introduction/>

## Long time ago

A long time ago, one of the secretaries of the HEIG-VD and I joked about a student catapult. I told her that I could make her one. But never took the time to do it. I think it would be a great idea to do it for this practical work. I can give you the resources you need to do it (hosting, domain name, etc.)
