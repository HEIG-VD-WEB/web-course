# About the feedback

Between the second and third week, the students were asked what they like about the course and what they would like to change. The feedback was collected using a Microsoft Form. The results are presented below.

- In general, students like less theory in lessons, but would like a common thread or skeleton to be more explicit. 
- Students would like to know what is important to know.
- There's a lack of interaction
- The students ask themself if the course material be available after
- The site is well done and you like the fact that there's one site to rule them all :ring:
- A desire to do the labs at home, given that they are to be done alone.

## What the teaching staff engage themself to do

- There will be small presentations to introduce the course material.
- The course material will be available after the course. Always and open-source. You can fork it.
