## Code of conduct
The idea is to create a Code of conduct for the classroom, either for the students, the assistants and the teacher.

Some first ideas are:

 - The students have their grades the sooner, the better
 - Their will not be big project at the end of the semester, all the work you do during the semester has the same value.
 - Respect of the time spent on thing
   - If students take 2-4 hours for a practice assignements, the teacher can not just automate the results without giving a review of the work done.
   - When the students invest time in something, invest it too
 - you will not learn by heart the error to not do it again, you will learn to use the tools what will help you to not do it again.
