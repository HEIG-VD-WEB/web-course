For the moment, this document groups ideas, concept and projects for the WEB course. And the first [presentation](./slides/0-organisation/index.md){:target="_blank"} of the course.

The overall of the courses will be an inverse classroom, as technology evolves, the need for a teacher to talk about slides for 1-2 hours is not needed anymore. The idea is to have a teacher that is here to help the students to learn, and not to teach them.

## Code of conduct
The idea is to create a Code of conduct for the classroom, either for the students, the assistants and the teacher.

Some first ideas are:

 - The students have their grades the sooner, the better
 - Their will not be big project at the end of the semester, all the work you do during the semester has the same value.
 - Respect of the time spent on thing
   - If students take 2-4 hours for a practice assignements, the teacher can not just automate the results without giving a review of the work done.
   - When the students invest time in something, invest it too
 - you will not learn by heart the error to not do it again, you will learn to use the tools what will help you to not do it again.

## Theory courses
For the theory periods, I have some concern and ideas.

 - Showing true code, not just slides
 - Showing exemples
 - A courses is typically like this:
   - quiz on the last week
   - theory
   - practice with tutorials

There will be 16 theory sessions:

  - **Organisation of the course**
    - Presentation of the staff
      - with pronouns
      - informal pronouns, like "tu" in french.
        - The respect is in the actions, not in the words.
        - But i'm not your friend, i'm your teacher.
      - I will do my best do be inclusive, but if I do something wrong, please tell me.
    - Objectives
    - Prerequisites
      - quiz to know the level of the students
        - git, github
        - devcontainer
        - HTML & CSS
        - javascript
        - typescript
        - Vue.js et React
        - Nuxt.js et Next.js
        - Informal or formal pronouns ?
        - next steps after the school
          - startup
          - big company
          - school assistant
        - Usage of copilot and other IA tools
    - Questions
      - don't hesitate to ask questions
      - if i'm talking and I see that you want to ask a question, i will give you a sign so you can rest your arm.
    - Teaching platform
      - Github
        - code
        - discussions
    - line-up of the course
    - Course
      - reverse learning, see the theory at home, and the practice in class
      - theory
      - practice
      - evaluation
        - No test on paper, the only paper we should be giving you is the diploma.
    - Creation of a code of conduct with all the classroom
      - use the quiz app to create it
    - If something goes wrong with my course or others. If you experience objectionable/hateful behavior, please contact me as soon as possible.

## Practice courses

All the practical courses will be available if they exist. If the students are ahead of schedule, they can help other, test new things or help enhance the course.

Some ideas for the assignement:

 - A compute viewer using the design pattern Composite
 - The top would be one application for the whole semester and we add features to it.
 - A chat application to ask question to the teacher without problem of privacy, or the need of prompting hands. The top would be to link it to a slide, so the question has meaning and we can enhance the slide.
 - Do a simple grades calculator with average and everything.
 - 

At the end of the assignement, there is a quiz to know how good it was.
